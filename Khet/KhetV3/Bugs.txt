Known bugs:

In free play if the fire laser button is spammed it leads to an error in AnimateRemoveLaser.
	- I think this is due to incorrect use of async await. as one thread is access .RightLaser another has cleared it.
	- Think I should switch to a task completion token.
	- Could maybe look into wrapping the call in a mutex.
	- If Laser animation changes then this may not be an issue.	
		E.g.:	- Have AnimateRemoveLaser await until laser loop is broken out of and then start
				- Control 

In game Logic when a Djed is switch with a pice the Laser reacts with the orientation of the old piece, it should 
react to the orientation of the Djed
